# Fractal Calculator Guide:


    Many other fractal calculators only measure and predict values for fractal objects such as coastlines or mountain ranges. This calculator uses fractal geometry to model both fractal and non fractal objects.

    All real world objects are not perfect fractals and their fractal dimension depends upon the scale at which you measure them. for example, you may see a coastline, a mountain range, or the leaves on a fern to be fractal objects, but their iterations do not continue infinitely, and thus their fractal dimension changes based upon their scale.

    This calculator allows you to model an object with various fractal dimensions, and capture its true nature.



    **Using the Calculator**

    The length 's' goes from highest to lowest, the value 'n' (the number of times s fits into the object) goes from lowest to highest. If this is not the case the program will throw an error. All measurements must have the same units.
